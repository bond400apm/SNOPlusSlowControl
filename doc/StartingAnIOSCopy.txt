Oh shoot!  Let's say one of your IOSes failed.  The simplest solution is
to copy one of them that is working to a new hard disk.

Once you copy the I/O Server disk and pop it in, you'll need to do a 
couple things. First, do the following:
* Set the IOS name
  vim /etc/conf.d/hostname
* Set the ios number in SNOPlusSlowControl/lib/config/iosconfig.log 
* Set the ios number near the top of SNOPlusSlowControl/util/IOSdeleteOldDocs.py
* Change the card configuration file to match what card hardware is
  current plugged into the IOS
  nano hmhj/lib/hmhj_layer1-0.2/priv/cards.conf
* Set the net configuration file correctly (see iosNetFiles.txt for the settings)
  nano /etc/conf.d/net
